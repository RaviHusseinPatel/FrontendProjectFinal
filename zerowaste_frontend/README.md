# Zero Waste API Frontend

Our website is designed to accommodate those wishing to make the most of their leftover ingredients through navigating our simple yet effective website.

## Project Overview

### The features we've incorporated are:

1. View all current recipes and ingredients
2. Selecting a existing ingredient shows all the associated recipes using this ingredient
3. Selecting a existing recipe shows all the information needed to make the recipe such as ingredients, cooking time , cooking method etc.
4. Once a recipe is selected it can be added to a seperate favourites list so it can be easily found and used
5. There are forms which allow for the adding of new recipes and ingredients 

### The set-up and instructions for browsing the website are as follows:
1. After opening the application in VSCode, ensure it is connected to your backend by implementing CORS. Following this, run your backend Java application .
2. After opening the Frontend Project, in the project’s terminal run --npm install—. Then, enter —npm start— to launch your localhost in your browser.
3. As we have used some react Icons, in the terminal run —npm i react-icons—
4. Your browser should load in the homepage. To navigate back to this page from any other, click the House icon at the top of the screen.
4. To view your recipes, click the recipe book icon. You should see a list of recipes and their calorie count. Click any recipe to view all of it’s details, I.e description, serving size etc. You can add this to your favourites list by clicking the favourite button below the item method. You can add your own recipes here too, by scrolling to the bottom of the screen and entering details about your new recipe, with a placeholder in each bar to tell you what information goes where.
5. To view your ingredients, click the chilli emoji. Here you should see a list of ingredients. Click on any one of them to view all associated recipes with that ingredient. You can add an ingredient using the form at the bottom of the screen.
6. Our application also includes access for our users to find out where our office would be based by clicking the google maps icon on the homepage. By clicking on the envelope icon they can be redirected to their mail application, with our company email already attached to the recipient list.
